**TASK 1**

To verify whether the ant with ID `i` can access room `j`, I compared each bit of the access number with the least significant 24 bits (bits 0–23) of number `n`. Initially, I moved the number containing both the ant ID and the desired rooms into the `edx` register, followed by a right shift of 24 bits, leaving me with only the most significant 8 bits, which now represent the ant's ID. Next, I moved the value from the `ant_permissions` vector into the `ecx` register to analyze its bits.

Assuming the ant cannot reserve one or more rooms, the label `bit_traversal` tracks the total number of compared bits. Since I started with 1, the 23rd bit will be set when the value in `ebx` equals 24. I then placed `1` in the `edx` register, filling the rest of the register with zeros except for the least significant bit. I used this to test whether the ant wanted access to room `j`. If not, I shifted both the number containing the permissions and the number representing the desired rooms to the right. If the ant wanted access, I applied a bitwise AND operation between 1 and the last bit of the permission number. If this results in `0`, it means the ant has no access, and the process skips to the end. If the ant has access to all desired rooms, I overwrite the initial value with `1` in the corresponding memory address.

**TASK 2**

- **SUBTASK 1:**
  I started by declaring the required structures as mentioned in the assignment. For sorting, I used the bubble sort algorithm with two nested loops: one with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and another with `j` ranging from `i+1` to `n`. I held the actual values of `i` and `j` in the `esi` and `edi` registers, while keeping the offsets for the comparison fields in the `eax` and `edx` registers.

  Initially, I calculated the offset from the `i` position using `struct_size` to correctly reach the field to be compared. I then checked the `.admin` field at position `i`. If it's set to `1`, we swap immediately as this is the admin, otherwise, we move on to comparing priorities. I increment the offset to access the `.prio` field, compare priorities, and if they are equal, move on to the username comparison. If the ASCII value of the first character in the username at position `i` is less than that at position `j`, I swap; otherwise, I move on.

  Swapping is done using the "cup method," saving the value in `ecx`, then using the stack to temporarily hold and swap values. The 4-byte registers allow us to swap the first 4 fields, while usernames are swapped byte-by-byte. Once done, the algorithm continues iterating through the requests.

- **SUBTASK 2:**
  I iterated through all `n` passwords, each offset by 2 from the start of each request. I checked if the least significant bit is `1`. If it is, I directly write `0` to the vector. If not, I applied a mask to ignore the bit. Similarly, for the most significant 8 bits, I checked the 8th bit and applied a mask. I repeated this process, testing bit-by-bit for both the least and most significant bits. If all checks are passed, the position in the vector is updated with `1`, otherwise, it’s marked with `0`.

**TASK 3**

- **TREYFER_CRYPT:**
  Due to the need for multiple variables, I used the stack and subtracted from `esp` to account for the variables. In the first step, I stored the 0th bit in the `eax` register, which would act as "t" throughout the process. Two loops were created: one to reset the round counter, and the other to iterate through each bit (0 to 7). After calculating the next bit by adding the key to `t` and clearing any overflow with an `and` operation, I applied the `sbox[t]` operation. I used a standard shift for left rotations and calculated `(i + 1) % 8`. The resulting index was used for the next bit.

- **TREYFER_DCRYPT:**
  This decryption algorithm follows a similar structure but with a few key differences. I added a "D" to the label names for clarity. This time, we start from the last bit and work backwards, following a similar modulo operation and checking overflow. After calculating `bottom - top`, we ensure no overflow occurs, and the bit is placed accordingly.

**TASK 4**

This task involved similar functions to the previous one, but instead of rows, columns were traversed, and movement directions were adjusted (e.g., down instead of up). All registers were used except for the pointer to the vector of pointers. For each movement (left, right, up, down), boundary checks ensured the traversal stayed within the matrix. For valid moves, the appropriate bits were updated.
